// The important thing to note is, there is no return type for power2(), the program still compiles and runs fine in most of the C compilers. In C, if we do not specify a return type, compiler assumes an implicit return type as int. However, C99 standard doesnâ€™t allow return type to be omitted even if return type is int. This was allowed in older C standard C89.

int power2(int x)
{
    return x * x;
}

int main(void)
{
    printf("%d\n", power2(10));
    return 0;
}
