/*
Any type of pointer variable takes the same memory bytes in the
memory, because they are used to store the memory addresses on other
type of variables.

Letâ€™s take an example - 
There are two pointers 
1) integer pointer and 
2) char pointer, 

integer pointer will take 4 bytes (in case of, 32 bits compiler) and
will store the address of integer variables only. char pointer will
also take 4 bytes but it will store the address of only char variable.
